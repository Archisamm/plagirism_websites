## WHAT TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE ASKS...

### "Why use JavaScript instead of a framework like React?"
**Answer:** "For this project, vanilla JavaScript is perfect because we don't need complex state management. The site is mostly content with a few interactive elements—mobile menu, form validation, smooth scrolling. Adding React would be overkill and make the site heavier. It's a principle of keeping things simple and performant."

### "Can users really book consultations with just a contact form?"
**Answer:** "Currently, yes. The form collects their inquiry, which gets submitted. For Phase 2, we'll add backend integration with a real booking calendar, email confirmations, and automated scheduling. But this contact form works great as a starting point and gets clients engaged."

### "What if there's high traffic?"
**Answer:** "Static websites can handle massive traffic because there's no database bottleneck. Even with 10,000 visitors, the server just delivers HTML/CSS/JS files—no processing needed. If we add backend later, we'd need database optimization, but the frontend stays lightweight."

### "How much did this cost to build?"
**Answer:** "As a frontend project, development costs are reasonable because there's no backend complexity. Hosting costs are minimal—could be free with GitHub Pages or $5-20/month with Netlify/Vercel. No database, no server infrastructure costs."

### "Is the contact form secure?"
**Answer:** "The client-side form validation is for UX. For production, we'd add backend validation and use secure email delivery (e.g., Nodemailer). Currently, it demonstrates the functionality—security would be implemented in Phase 2 with backend integration."

### "How long until they start getting bookings?"
**Answer:** "The site is ready to go live now. Once deployed, it could start generating inquiries immediately through the contact form and CTA buttons. With proper SEO (keywords, meta tags, Google My Business), it would start ranking within 2-3 months."
